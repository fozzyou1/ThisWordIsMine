In order to use all of the character asset states in The Succubus Twins Character Pack,

- 2. Bring the model into the scene and then double click on it.
- 3. In the Inspector Tab look for the "Quality" setting and change it from "Auto" to "4 Bones."
- 4. Now you are finished.
- 5. In addition, this procedure must be followed for each model you bring into the scene.

Method 2
- 1. Choose Edit > Project > Settings > Quality.
